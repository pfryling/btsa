Events will appear on our calendar so make sure you check it out, and there will be plenty of opportunities for you to come join a club event! BTSA is looking for passionate members to join us as part of the executive board as interns for the upcoming semester. Interns will get a chance to sharpen their leadership skills, learn what it takes to be an officer of a major club on campus, and put together events and activities for the BTSA. Interns will also receive priority consideration during the upcoming Spring election for all positions including president and vice president.
