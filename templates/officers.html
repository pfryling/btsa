                        <p>Hello Biology enthusiasts! My name is Jenny Waters, and I am an undergrad student pursuing my B.S. in the field of Biology. I just recently changed to this major, and I am very excited to so quickly have found a niche with so many amazing opportunities. Getting to be amongst such motivated professionals in the making, especially in an area with as much Biotech as San Diego, is a fantastic start to any career and a wonderful networking opportunity. I am very interested in stem cell research in particular, and hope to find a position in a lab where I can expand my knowledge on this subject. Outside of this club, I am also a dual athlete actively participating in the Women's Club Water Polo team here at SDSU while training for competitions in some of the many triathlons offered in this area. Feel free to contact me with any questions, my email is watersjen1@hotmail.com.

                        <p>Hello and welcome everyone. I am currently in my fourth year studying mechanical engineering with a bio-engineering emphasis here at SDSU. I am the VP of the BTSA club this year, and I look forward to a great year with new members. Along with being a full time student I enjoy playing video games online and connecting with others. That is why I am here in the BTSA to introduce students to what we have to offer. Here at the BTSA club we promote student growth and have insightful discussion with members of different companies and organizations. We wish to help students with that first step into getting an internship or those students searching to make a connection with professionals in their field. I look forward to meeting all the new people next year in the BTSA club. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at Harryho416@gmail.com.

                        <p>Hello, BTSA members! My name is Daniel Gonzales and I am a senior majoring in biology. After graduating, my aim is to enroll in medical school and earn a license in pharmacy. Pharmacy is, personally, the most interesting and dynamic field in medicine. As new discoveries are being made, my inspiration to pursue this medical practice grows. BTSA has further opened my eyes to medicine and how much the field has thrived over the years. As an officer dedicated to this club, it will be my pleasure to learn more about biomedical technology with you all and hope to see you at our meetings!

                        <p>Hello Future life changers! My name is Jamila White. I am an L.A. native who made her way up and out of the crazy streets of LA. I am currently a second year Biology student at San Diego State (GO AZTECS). I plan on going into the medical field under pediatrics. I absolutely love children; although I do not have any of my own, I support them because they are our future. Believe it or not we need the most support when we are youngens, so I want to be there to make a change and provide as much support as I can! I was in so many different activities in High School, but I'm in college now and it's time to start fresh! I've just become a member of BTSA in 2014 and was elected as Social Media Rep. So far I love the club and what it provides for its members. The opportunity to be at a four year University and be an officer in BTSA is ultimately awesome. When I am not in class, studying, or engaging in BTSA activities, I am either working hard at my 9-5 or hanging out with a few friends. I am open for all invitations and events that contribute to the well-being and benefits of others in the community. If anyone has questions, suggestions, career recommendations, etc reach me at white_jamila@yahoo.com! Or you can post on our social network sites! www.facebook.com/SDSUBTSA, twitter.com/SDSUBTSA, or "BTSA at SDSU" LinkedIn. I am usually fast at replying.

                        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Michelle Pinchart, and I am an undergraduate student pursuing my B.S. in the biological sciences. I grew up in Japan and moved to San Diego in 2010, a year before starting my college career. I have found my passion in the biological and chemical sciences during my second year of college, and that passion has grown larger and larger as time has passed. More specifically, I am intrigued by evolutionary and marine biology, and a life-long goal of mine has been to help others and make the world a better place. I believe that through biological research, I will have the opportunity to achieve this goal. Outside of school, I like to hike, sight-see, go running, and relax on the beach. This club has given me an insight to the various aspects of the biotechnological field, and I believe it will do the same to anyone who is interested in a career in the biological sciences.

I aspire to be a clinical lab scientist in the future, and hopefully become a lab supervisor later on. As much as I would love to work on school stuff every day, I also make sure that I make time for the other things I love doing such as hiking, reading books, cooking, stargazing, playing games, and watching my favorite TV shows such as the Big Bang Theory, Bones, Game of Thrones and Sherlock. This will be my second semester being a member of the BTSA Club, and I'm definitely looking forward to all the speakers and tours we are going to have this year!

                        <p>After receiving his Ph. D. from the University of Sussex, in England studying nitrogen regulation in bacteria, Dr. Edwards moved to the United States to continue his studies. He worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher with Dr. Dieter Schifferli at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, understanding the mechanisms and regulation of virulence of enterotoxigenic E. coli, a leading cause of traveler’s diarrhea. Dr. Edwards then moved to the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign to work with Dr. Stanley Maloy on understanding the virulence of Salmonella. These studies merged the nascent area of genomics with traditional microbial genomics to investigate the virulence of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, a leading bacterial cause of food-borne illness. During this period, Dr. Edwards began sequencing several Salmonella genomes, and began collaborating on the open-source BioPerl project, to which he remains an active contributor.

                                Most recently, Dr. Edwards has returned to academia, and taken a research and teaching position in the Department of Computer Science at San Diego State University. Here he is continuing to work at the interface of biology and computing, but also expanding his research into grid-enabled research and high performance computing. Dr. Edwards has written open-source code for high performance parallel computing that is used worldwide.

                                    Dr. Edwards research is currently funded by the National Science Foundation, and aims to bring high performance computing to the smallest biological organisms – the viruses. Edwards’ research is leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of how viruses interact with their hosts, and how viruses samples from around the world carry important genetic information.

                                        Dr. Edwards maintains strong interactions with biologists, working closely with groups sequencing uncultured microbes (“metagenomes”) from diverse environments such as human samples, oceans, coral reefs, and mines. In addition to bioinformatics analysis Dr. Edwards is also a scientific SCUBA diver having studied both Pacific and Atlantic Coral Reefs, and also enjoys racing sailboats.
