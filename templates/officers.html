Hello, my name is Jennifer Fouquier.  I am one of the 2013-2014 Co-chairs of SDSU BTSA.  I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Bioinformatics at SDSU, where I am learning advanced computational methods to analyze biological data. I joined <a href="http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/kelley/scottkelley.htm">Dr. Scott Kelley's Laboratory</a> in Spring 2013, where I am using culture-independent molecular methods to study fungal diversity in the indoor environment.  At age 16 I began to work in the biotechnology industry, and since then have held many positions, adding to over 10 years of industry experience.  My jobs have involved studying cardiac electrophysiology, manufacturing protein controls for medical diagnostic instruments, performing microbiology and chemistry assays, performing molecular biology experiments for a stem cell research company, etc.  Keeping on good terms with my colleagues, both professionally and personally, has allowed me to have an excellent network within the science industry.  I hope to use my professional experience to serve our club as much as possible.  In addition to all of the above, I am a first-generation college student, so I can relate to those of you who have had to overcome the same obstacles. Please feel free to contact me if you would like any advice or guidance at: jennietf@gmail.com.

Hi Biotech lovers! My name is Lauryn Keeler and I am a second year in the Bioinformatics master's program at San Diego State. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Chemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara (go gauchos!). As an undergrad I was extremely involved in local politics and helped organize the campus Voter Registration drive.  At UCSB, I also conducted scientific research with Dr. Songi Han testing water exclusion through DNP.  After graduating, I worked as an analytical chemist at ALS Environmental (formally Columbia Analytical Services) testing air using gas chromatography for clients like the Air Force and Habitat for Humanity. Recently I had the privilege of joining Dr. Kelly Doran's lab group at SDSU where I am studying the genomic sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS). I am extremely excited to be the Co-Chair of BTSA for the 2013-2014 school year. I hope to expose students to contacts in the scientific industry and to introduce the industry to SDSU biotech students and the many skills they have to offer to companies. Please feel free to email me any questions regarding the club or the Bioinformatics program: laurynrk@gmail.com.

<p>
  Hello and welcome everyone. I am currently a third year undergrad studying bio-engineering here at SDSU. I am currently enrolling into a Biomedical exploration program run by the school and am working in the bioscience center run by <a href="http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/gottlieb.html">Dr. Roberta Gottlieb</a> under the guidence of <a href="http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/bsc/biosketch.php?i=bsc_research_ito_i.html&t=bsc_research_ito_t.html">Dr. Bruce Ito</a>. Along with being a full time student I enjoy playing video games online and connecting with others. That is why I am here in the BTSA to introduce students to what we have to offer. Here at the BTSA club we promote student growth and have insightful discussion with members of different companies and organizations. We wish to help students with that first step into getting an internship or those students searching to make a connection with professionals in their field. I may not have been in this club for long, but I can honestly say that I look forward to the different experiences and opportunities I will have in the BTSA.

<h4>BTSA Campus Advisor:</h4><h3>Dr. Robert Edwards</h3>
<img src="http://edwards.sdsu.edu/labsite/images/stories/member_pics/rob_2.jpg" style="float:left;margin:0 10px 0 0;">

After receiving his Ph. D. from the University of Sussex, in England studying nitrogen regulation in bacteria, Dr. Edwards moved to the United States to continue his studies. 
He worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher with Dr. Dieter Schifferli at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, understanding the mechanisms and regulation of virulence of enterotoxigenic E. coli, a leading cause of traveler’s diarrhea. 
Dr. Edwards then moved to the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign to work with Dr. Stanley Maloy on understanding the virulence of Salmonella. These studies merged the nascent area of genomics with traditional microbial genomics to investigate the virulence of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, a leading bacterial cause of food-borne illness. 
During this period, Dr. Edwards began sequencing several Salmonella genomes, and began collaborating on the open-source BioPerl project, to which he remains an active contributor.
<p>
  Most recently, Dr. Edwards has returned to academia, and taken a research and teaching position in the Department of Computer Science at San Diego State University. Here he is continuing to work at the interface of biology and computing, but also expanding his research into grid-enabled research and high performance computing. 
  Dr. Edwards has written open-source code for high performance parallel computing that is used worldwide.
<p>
  Dr. Edwards research is currently funded by the National Science Foundation, and aims to bring high performance computing to the smallest biological organisms – the viruses. Edwards’ research is leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of how viruses interact with their hosts, and how viruses samples from around the world carry important genetic information.
<p>
  Dr. Edwards maintains strong interactions with biologists, working closely with groups sequencing uncultured microbes (“metagenomes”) from diverse environments such as human samples, oceans, coral reefs, and mines. In addition to bioinformatics analysis Dr. Edwards is also a scientific SCUBA diver having studied both Pacific and Atlantic Coral Reefs, and also enjoys racing sailboats.

In August, 2002 he moved to San Diego State University as founding Director of the Center for Microbial Sciences and Professor of Biology. 
<p>
  Stanley is Past-President of the American Society for Microbiology, the oldest and largest single life science membership organization in the world. He has had numerous roles at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, teaching the summer course in Advanced Bacterial Genetics from 1990-1995, the advanced graduate course in Microbial Pathogenesis at the Watson Graduate School from 2002-2006, and was co-founder of the international symposium on Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Response. 
  He has taught numerous international courses and organized many international scientific meetings. He is the author of several books, and has won multiple awards for teaching. He has consulted for large companies and small, biotech start-up companies, served on the Scientific Advisory Board of several companies, and as Chief Scientific Officer of Vaxiion Therapeutics. 
  He served as chair of the NIH MBC1 Study Section and as an advisor for many national and international scientific agencies for Microbial Sciences and Professor of Biology.
