My name is Jenny Waters, and I am an undergrad student pursuing my B.S. in the field of Biology. I just recently changed to this major, and I am very excited to so quickly have found a niche with so many amazing opportunities. Getting to be amongst such motivated professionals in the making, especially in an area with as much Biotech as San Diego, is a fantastic start to any career and a wonderful networking opportunity. I am very interested in stem cell research in particular, and hope to find a position in a lab where I can expand my knowledge on this subject. Outside of this club, I am also a dual athlete actively participating in the Women's Club Water Polo team here at SDSU while training for competitions in some of the many triathlons offered in this area. Feel free to contact me with any questions, my email is watersjen1@hotmail.com.

My name is Jamila White. I am an L.A. native who made her way up and out of the crazy streets of LA. I am currently a second year Biology student at San Diego State (GO AZTECS). I plan on going into the medical field under pediatrics. I absolutely love children; although I do not have any of my own, I support them because they are our future.  Believe it or not we need the most support when we are youngens, so I want to be there to make a change and provide as much support as I can! I was in so many different activities in High School, but I'm in college now and it's time to start fresh! I've just become a member of BTSA in 2014 and was elected as Social Media Rep. So far I love the club and what it provides for its members. The opportunity to be at a four year University and be an officer in BTSA is ultimately awesome. When I am not in class, studying, or engaging in BTSA activities, I am either working hard at my 9-5 or hanging out with a few friends. I am open for all invitations and events that contribute to the well-being and benefits of others in the community. If anyone has questions, suggestions, career recommendations, etc reach me at white_jamila@yahoo.com! Or you can post on our social network sites! www.facebook.com/SDSUBTSA, twitter.com/SDSUBTSA, or "BTSA at SDSU" LinkedIn. I am usually fast at replying.

<img src="img/Current Officer pictures/Michelle_P.PNG" width="156" height="208" style="float:left;margin:0 10px 0 0;padding-bottom:20px;height:200px"> Hello everyone! My name is Michelle Pinchart, and I am an undergraduate student pursuing my B.S. in the biological sciences. I grew up in Japan and moved to San Diego in 2010, a year before starting my college career. I have found my passion in the biological and chemical sciences during my second year of college, and that passion has grown larger and larger as time has passed. More specifically, I am intrigued by evolutionary and marine biology, and a life-long goal of mine has been to help others and make the world a better place. I believe that through biological research, I will have the opportunity to achieve this goal. Outside of school, I like to hike, sight-see, go running, and relax on the beach. This club has given me an insight to the various aspects of the biotechnological field, and I believe it will do the same to anyone who is interested in a career in the biological sciences.

<h4>BTSA Campus Advisor:</h4><h3>Dr. Robert Edwards</h3>
 <img src="img/Current Officer pictures/robedwards.jpg" style="float:left;margin:0 10px 0 0;padding-bottom:20px;height:200px">

After receiving his Ph. D. from the University of Sussex, in England studying nitrogen regulation in bacteria, Dr. Edwards moved to the United States to continue his studies. 
He worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher with Dr. Dieter Schifferli at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, understanding the mechanisms and regulation of virulence of enterotoxigenic E. coli, a leading cause of traveler’s diarrhea. 
Dr. Edwards then moved to the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign to work with Dr. Stanley Maloy on understanding the virulence of Salmonella. These studies merged the nascent area of genomics with traditional microbial genomics to investigate the virulence of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, a leading bacterial cause of food-borne illness. 
During this period, Dr. Edwards began sequencing several Salmonella genomes, and began collaborating on the open-source BioPerl project, to which he remains an active contributor.
<p>
  Most recently, Dr. Edwards has returned to academia, and taken a research and teaching position in the Department of Computer Science at San Diego State University. Here he is continuing to work at the interface of biology and computing, but also expanding his research into grid-enabled research and high performance computing. 
  Dr. Edwards has written open-source code for high performance parallel computing that is used worldwide.
<p>
  Dr. Edwards research is currently funded by the National Science Foundation, and aims to bring high performance computing to the smallest biological organisms – the viruses. Edwards’ research is leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of how viruses interact with their hosts, and how viruses samples from around the world carry important genetic information.
<p>
  Dr. Edwards maintains strong interactions with biologists, working closely with groups sequencing uncultured microbes (“metagenomes”) from diverse environments such as human samples, oceans, coral reefs, and mines. In addition to bioinformatics analysis Dr. Edwards is also a scientific SCUBA diver having studied both Pacific and Atlantic Coral Reefs, and also enjoys racing sailboats.
<p>
  
<h4>Dean of the College of Sciences:</h4><h3>Dr. Stanley Maloy</h3>
 <img src="img/Current Officer pictures/Stanley_M.jpg" width="171" style="float:left;margin:0 10px 0 0;padding-bottom:20px;height:200px">

After earning a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the University of California at Irvine, Stanley did postdoctoral work in Genetics at the University of Utah, then joined the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign faculty in 1984 where he was promoted through the ranks to Professor and Director of the Biotechnology Center. 
In August, 2002 he moved to San Diego State University as founding Director of the Center for Microbial Sciences and Professor of Biology. 
<p>
  Stanley is Past-President of the American Society for Microbiology, the oldest and largest single life science membership organization in the world. He has had numerous roles at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, teaching the summer course in Advanced Bacterial Genetics from 1990-1995, the advanced graduate course in Microbial Pathogenesis at the Watson Graduate School from 2002-2006, and was co-founder of the international symposium on Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Response. 
  He has taught numerous international courses and organized many international scientific meetings. He is the author of several books, and has won multiple awards for teaching. He has consulted for large companies and small, biotech start-up companies, served on the Scientific Advisory Board of several companies, and as Chief Scientific Officer of Vaxiion Therapeutics. 
  He served as chair of the NIH MBC1 Study Section and as an advisor for many national and international scientific agencies for Microbial Sciences and Professor of Biology.
